# 30 Days CSS Animation Challenge

Welcome to my **30 Days CSS Animation Challenge** repository! ðŸŽ‰

Over the next 30 days, I'll be creating and sharing one CSS animation project per day. The goal of this challenge is to improve my skills in CSS animations and explore creative ways to design interactive web elements.

## Challenge Goals
- Enhance my CSS animation skills.
- Experiment with different animation techniques.
- Build a consistent habit of coding daily.
- Share my work and inspire others to start their own challenges.

## Projects
Each day, I'll add a new project folder to this repository containing:
- The animation project.
- A short description of the animation.
- Code files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if needed).
